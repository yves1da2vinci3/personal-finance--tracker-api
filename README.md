# Personal Finance Tracker API

This API provides a RESTful interface for managing personal finances. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete expenses and incomes.

## Getting Started

To install the dependencies, run the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To create the database, run the following command:

```
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

To start the API, run the following command:

```
flask run


The API will be available on port 5000.

## Authentication

The API uses JWT authentication. To authenticate a user, you can use the `/auth/login` endpoint. This endpoint requires the username and password of the user.

Once a user is authenticated, they will be given a JWT token. This token can be used to access the other endpoints in the API.

## Endpoints

The API has the following endpoints:

* `/auth/login` - Login a user
* `/auth/register` - Register a new user
* `/incomes` - Get all incomes
* `/incomes/create` - Create a new income
* `/incomes/update` - Update an income
* `/incomes/delete` - Delete an income
* `/expenses` - Get all expenses
* `/expenses/create` - Create a new expense
* `/expenses/update` - Update an expense
* `/expenses/delete` - Delete an expense

## Testing

The API has a number of tests that can be run using the `pytest` command. To run the tests, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
